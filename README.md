How to overcome obstacles:
Clear, direct communication with high frequency.
Communicating expectations of when we are not available on Slack. Being available on Slack.
Problem solving process -> struggle for maximum of 30 minutes, reach out to each other, reach out to peers, reach out to Mod 3, reach out to mentors/instructors (Take poms)

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): Erry day...

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Consult Ian

Strategies to Minimize Git Fires:
Pull request surveys. Tom will share with group.
Before merging to master.
Fetch to local before merging and run rspec.
Mackenzie will share bash prompt with Maddie so branch name is in prompt.
Always checkout a branch is new changes are made.
When a user story is closed, add the full user story to the PR via copy and paste.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
Justin -> Unavailable from the 22nd-25th (including the 22nd and 25th)  Justin will be offline. Justin may check slack but will cap it at 15 minutes a day.
